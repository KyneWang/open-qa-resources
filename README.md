# QA Resources
Here is my own collection of open question answering resources, including papers, datasets, code(if available). Particularly, my research projects focus on **(1) question answering based on knowledge base; (2) question answering based on document retrieval; (3) knowledge graph**. So the selected papers of this curated list may not lie beyond these topics.
